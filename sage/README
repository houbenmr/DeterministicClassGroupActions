A SageMath implementation of a NIKE
using orientations given as a composition
of two isogenies of smooth degree
including several precomputed parameters.

We use a package by Giacomo Pope
for x-only arithmetic and isogenies
https://github.com/GiacomoPope/KummerIsogeny

Simply run

sage p255.sage

(or any other value for p).

The value after p is the bitsize of the prime;
this corresponds to an orientation by an order
with discriminant of size roughly 4p^2.

WARNING: the setup of public parameters for
the scheme is slow for large parameters.
